        <h2>Design Patterns with facebook api</h2>
        <p>A .net Application that uses Facebook's api, while implementing design patterns from the book "gang of 4".
            The app has features which facebook doesn't has, such as downloading a full albums to computer, analyzing posts statistics and more.

        <h2>Opposite Tic Tac Toe</h2>
        <p>Opposite Tic Tac Toe is a unique twist on the classic game where the loser is the player who successfully forms three in a row. This project was developed as a .NET Windows application and provides a fun and challenging gaming experience with a different objective.</p>

        <h2>Finding Bridges in Undirected Graphs</h2>
        <p>This project is a C++ program that examines an undirected graph to determine if it's connected and, if so, identifies all the bridges within the graph. It accomplishes this by implementing graph algorithms to analyze the connectivity of the graph and find critical bridges, which can be important for network design and analysis.</p>

        <h2>Eulerian Graph Checker</h2>
        <p>This C++ program is designed to determine if a given graph is Eulerian, and if it is, it finds and prints the Eulerian circle within the graph. The program prompts the user to specify whether the graph is directed or not, the number of vertices, and the number of arcs. It then reads the pairs of arcs and applies graph algorithms to determine Eulerian properties.</p>
