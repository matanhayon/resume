        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Matan, and I'm a 27-year-old computer science student in my third year of studies. I'm passionate about programming and technology, and I'm excited to share a bit about myself with you.</p>

        <h2>Life Beyond the Keyboard</h2>
        <p>When I'm not tangled up in code, I'm all about that guitar riff, chasing waves, and getting cozy with the deep blue sea. You'll often catch me on the court, ballin' or kicking it on the soccer field. I believe in keeping things balanced. Learning is my jam, and that goes way beyond tech stuff. I'm all about exploring new tech and other cool ideas, whether they live in the digital realm or the real world.</p>
